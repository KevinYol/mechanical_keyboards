          <p>In this growing technological era, keyboards play a significant role on the input of data on many devices. Originating from the typewriter, keyboards have gone from typing directly onto paper and now to  computer screens or mobile devices. The keyboards now also have increased in functionality and has even gone digital such as on cell phones or tablets for example.</p>
          <p>For those who work on physical keyboards day-to-day for work, gaming, research/studies, or daily entertainment, the keyboard has not only changed from its functionality but also its aesthetics. Keyboard enthusiasts have also dabbled into this world of building and customizing mechanical keyboards to not only function well for their needs but also have the looks and feel to provide a more pleasureable experience when typing. There are many aspects to look at when deciding on what keyboard is best for you and we will go through each section to decide what kind of keyboard to look for. </p>

          <header>Functionality</header>
          <article>
            <p>To begin your search for a keyboard, you must decide what functions you need to have on your keyboard. The original keyboard, also known as a full keyboard has about 101-104 keys which are your basic letters, function keys at the top, a second set of numbers on a numpad, arrow keys, and seperate function keys such as the page up, page down and home buttons. Some of the keys are unnecessary such as the numpad because there is already an extra set of numbers above the section of letters on the keypad. Others may prefer extra keys to customize and function that have extra keys towards the left, right, or above the original set of keys. </p>

          <header>Sizing</header>
          <article>
            <p>The next thing you will need to decide is the size of keyboard you would like. This step depends on which keys you want to keep or remove and the amount of spacing you would like on your desktop. You can go for a full keyboard if you want all the keys that it provides you, a Ten-keyless keyboard that removes the numpad, or a 60-65% that removes the home and page up/down buttons. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Full size</code> keyboards have all the keys you need and maybe more. However they can take up a lot of space on your desk. The keyboard provides all functions and more within your finger tips allowing you to also customize keybindings to extra keys performing own specific function.</li>
              <li><code>Ten-keyless</code> or <var>"TKL"</var> keyboards remove the numpad and is a bit more compact than a full keyboard without removing other functioning buttons such as page control buttons.</li>
              <li><code>Compact 60-65%</code> Keyboards take up a lot less space on your desk to have a more uncluttered look. However, it may take away some functional buttons that you may find necessary during work such as function keys or arrow key requiring remapping or key-binds to access the functions. </li>

            <p>The connection between the keyboard and computer can either be wired or not wired. Wired connection allows for direct connection between the two without requiring a rechargeable battery however, it may look messy in your workspace or limit your space away from the desktop. Wireless keyboards will clean up the look of your desktop however requires charging or batteries.</p>

          <article>
            <p>RGB lighting is another small factor when choosing/customizing your keyboard. If you work/use your keyboard at night, this is a great option to have in order for you to also visually see your keyboard. Many times people also just enjoy the look of their keyboard with lights. There are some keyboards that have more colors or different light effects that you can choose. If you find the lights annoying then you can skip this part.</p>

          <header>Switches</header>
          <article>
            <p>Choosing a type of switch is more for aesthetics. It's one of the keyways to really provide pleasure on how the keyboard feels and sounds like when you type on it. There are three main types of switches:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Linear</code> switches provide less force, more quieter, and less feedback when you type.</li>
              <li><code>Tactile</code> switches have a slight bump that notify you when you press the key, are slightly quiet, and require a little more force to press each key.</li>
              <li><code>Clicky</code> switches are loud and provide the most feedback when you are typing on the keyboard.</li>
            </ul>

          <header>Hot-Swap</header>
          <article>
            <p>Hot-swappable keyboards mean you can change parts of the keyboard frequently. Originally, keyboards have been made where their switches are soldered together to the pcb of the keyboard and are irreplaceable. Hot-swappable keyboards allow you to frequently change each mechanical switch whenever you'd like. Many people who get tired of their switches or want to test out different switches for a certain amount of time have the freedom to do so. Therefore deciding on whether the keyboard his hot-swappable depends on the user. </p>

            <p>Keyboard enthusiasts try to make a cool color scheme or choose keycaps that match their whole design or look of their computer setup. There are many different color combinations to choose from or you can go simple with one color.</p>

          <header>Recommendations</header>
          <article>
            <p>One of my top recommendations for getting a first customizable mechanical keyboard is from a company called "Glorious". They only have wired keyboards however you can choose different color keyboard, size, switches, and even the pcb plate to provide a more pleasureable sound when you type.</p>
